# Project Euler in Haskell
Trying to learn Haskell by solving some of the problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

Beware that I have just begun my journey with Haskell so there is probably a lot of room for improvements. 
If you find something that could be done in a better/smarter/more interesting way you are more than welcome to help me out by 
creating a ticket explaining the improvement.

Happy Hacking!!! :-)
